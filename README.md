# OOPS! Evaluation plugin
A plug-in for the [Protégé Desktop](http://protege.stanford.edu/) ontology editor software that evaluates ontologies to detect the use of bad practices.

It makes use of the [OOPS! (OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner)](http://oops.linkeddata.es/) ontology evaluation web service, developed by the [OEG(Ontology Engineering Group)](http://www.oeg-upm.net/) at [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](http://fi.upm.es/).

To install the plugin before it is published in the [Protege Plugin Library](http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Protege_Plugin_Library), download the latest release of this repository and place the **.jar** file inside the ``plugins`` folder of your Protégé installation.
